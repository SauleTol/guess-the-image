Dog Breed Classification Model

This project involves creating a machine learning model that predicts the breed of a dog based on its image. The model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model suitable for image classification tasks.

##Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing images of dogs, categorized into different breeds. The link to dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/70-dog-breedsimage-data-set

The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the input images. The final layers include fully connected layers with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting and a softmax layer for multi-class classification of dog breeds.
